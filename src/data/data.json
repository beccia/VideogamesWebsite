            "conclusion": "Yes, it is the real deal. Okay it didn’t send a ripple of life altering creative destruction throughout the entire games industry, altering the medium forever and kicking off a new era of new videogames, but, but then again I’d say that was an unrealistic expectation anyway. But it did deliver a truly fresh and interesting gameplay behind the concept of the “social strand” game. Most notably the idea that the challenge is in traversing the world itself rather than in fighting enemies, and in the indirect interactions with other players helping each other are cool and rewarding features. With the typical Kojima style of storytelling and character design on top of that this game is indeed a masterpiece (be it maybe less so than the almost biblical hype surrounding it) and it does bring a beautiful, immersing and inspiring experience.  Really worth looking into.",
        "name": "So what about Death Stranding?",
        "intro": "Love it or hate it, but Death Stranding is one of the most attention grabbing games of the year 2019 for sure. From the first trailer up until very close to release date (and for many people after that, still) this game has been surrounded by hype, mystery and wtf. According to Kojima fans it would turn out to be an innovative creation of genius that would change the gaming game. At the time of writing I haven’t finished it so this is not a review, but it’s more of a reflection on the game in the light of it’s hype. ",

Kojima still has it"}], [{"title": "ds2.1", "text": "My dude Sam chilling in the pivate room"}, {"title":"ds2.2", "text": "This is where the game got real for me"}, {"title":"ds2.3", "text":"The world is impressive, like this voidout crater here"}]],
        "text": [["Early on in the days where there was nothing but short trailers featuring a baby in a pod Kojima mentioned the rope and the stick, mankind’s first inventions: one to hit whatever you don’t like, and the other to keep whatever you do like with you. At the time that was an “uuuuuhm, okay…? ” kind of explanation concerning the gameplay. And then it came out and it turned out that you do actually just carry stuff from one place to another. Of course there’s lots of complications and this and thats but in the most basic sense that is actually what you do in the game. When I just started playing I wasn’t too excited for that at all.\\nThen there’s this mission early in the game where you have to carry the corpse of an important person to an incinerator on a mountain (when you play the game you’ll know why a dude needs to carry a corpse to an incinerator on a mountain) and at some point this emotional music starts to play (of the kind which I usually hate) while you are making your way over these empty hills and at that moment the feeling of this game just clicked and I knew I was going to love it. It has this same feel of dramatic rebuilding of civilization in the wasteland, similar to for example Fallout games but in a different way. Soon you realize it’s not really about delivering stuff, but it’s about building connections between people and seeing the connected territory expand does feel very rewarding. "],
         ["The game is very cinematic and atmospherical, especially when playing with headphones.  You will grow attached to the little baby in the yellow pod you carry with you and you will feel intrigued and strangely endeared by flashes of a man played by Mads Mikkelsen trying to be a good dad for it. The music fits the theme and general style very well and I remember seeing an interview with Kojima some months before the release in which he mentioned that you can rest in your own private room and that it’s really cool and I had to laugh because I thought it didn’t sound cool at all, silly Kojima. But now I think it is. Putting on your favorite in-game song while watching Norman Reedus drinking a beer in his subterranean private room after hauling along 200+ kg’s of cargo through rough terrain feels just feels cozy.\\nSome of the early criticisms I have seen is that the big open world is too empty. And in some ways this is true. There’s few enemies who are usually found in certain spots only. There’s also little in terms of items to pick-up, NPC’s, towns or whatever; the world is indeed a mostly empty natural world. Surprisingly, I found this to be not boring but nice. I was actually growing somewhat tired of playing an open world game and constantly having the urge to check out every corner, look around for every conversation and do all the side-quests and find hidden items everywhere, and in Death Stranding there’s no need to do these things. The sooner you can get from A to B and just arrive where you want to go without detours, the better. I found this to be strangely liberating. \\nThe enemy, or rather the challenging element to conquer with your wits and skills, is the territory itself. If you are like me you will first run into the old habit of still beelining towards every objective, stubbornly mashing the climb button on steep cliffs, falling over & damaging your cargo a few times before you realize that it doesn’t work like that in this game. And then you will actually start out by examining the map, and looking around every so many meters to see whether your approach makes sense, and you will be arguing internally whether you should place that ladder now or take the long route and keep the ladder in case you need it later. Safely reaching your destination does feel good every time. Later on you will be able to build some structures (like a watchtower or a shelter) and even roads in the world."],
          ["The game’s most interesting feature however is the indirect multiplayer element. You will never encounter another player, but you can leave signs for others and most importantly you will be able to use some of the structures built by others in the world. It is unknown to me exactly what determines what structures form what players you can see, but as soon as you connect an area to the “chiral network” (this is a central element the game’s story progression, basically a sort of internet+ that places need to be connected to) you will start seeing signs and structures. And you can like them (as in, social media-style like something). \\nIt might feel a bit weird at first, but by the time I built my first road and seeing thousands of likes pouring in from player who travelled on them I realized the games most rewarding aspect. It’s really cool to both use things left for you by your internet bros who you don’t know and sending out some likes, and also to leave stuff in the right places to make life easier for them as well. You’ll not just looking around to see how you are going to get through an area, but also to see where you might construct something that will be the most useful for others.  Laying down a zip-line which connects to other ziplines made by online players and thus creating a network that saver everyone a shitton of time feels amazing. "]]},

        "name": "Dragon Quest XI",
        "intro": "When Dragon quest XI released, it was the first game I got on day 1 and took a free day for in a long while. I love Dragon Ball and Toriyama’s artstyle, and I remember player the shit out of Dragon Warrior Monsters and some Dragon Warrior (I think 2?) on the Game Boy Color so I was hyped. So I unpacked it, enjoyed that delicious new game smell, made some coffee and started a glorious full day of playing my new game. ",
        "score": "8.4",
        "conclusion": "Even though I must admit that around the 85 hour playtime mark there was a short while where I though “okay I’m ready for this game to end now” this lasted only shortly and when I did actually finish it I felt about sad about that. It was a beautiful journey, starting as a nobody with shitty equipment, through excitedly visiting the capital for the first time, getting the JRPG classic boat, later on flying whale-thingy all the way to being the full-fledged chosen one with superstring end-game equipment, stats and attacks. The turn-based gameplay, exploring, questing is all very good but the best thing is just the general feeling of following the adventure in this beautiful world, enjoying the excellent visuals, art style and music (yes I liked it, even when it never stopped). \\nThe pace is somewhat slow and could be higher. And I’m not talking about the cutscenes since that’s kinda part of the genre but I’m talking the pacing of the game. The rate at which the more interesting game mechanics, special skills and difficulty increase are introduced could be higher. However, the sheer beauty and magical vibe of the game easily compensates for this. And late in the game you will need to make use of the most elaborate crafting and combat mechanics of the game to beat the end-game bosses. Stick through these moments when it feels a bit too slow and you’re appetite for this game will soon be revitalized in the game’s next phase.\\nDragon Quest XI is a glorious return of a fan favorite, one of the best games on the PS4 (and Switch) and an absolute must play for anyone who likes (J)RPG’s. And it does definitely show that the JRPG genre hasn’t per definition aged bad and that they can adapt to the current gen and be great. ",

        "text" : [["The game is incredibly old school JRPG from the start, including a starting mission where you’re armed with a stick and need to find your native village rascal who went in some cave with monsters. But as soon as you walk up a mountain you notice that it looks really good. Obviously the graphics are technically less impressive than the real lookers like Red Dead Redemption 2, but the style itself does look amazing. As far as cell-shaded style graphics go this is the best you’ve ever seen for sure. Seeing this Toriyama style within the beautiful green world was amazing from that first mission on. The game’s presentation is spotless, from intuitive UI’s to the cutscenes and music and the gameplay is very solid  JRPG with a classic turn-based battle system. And I mean really solid JRPG. It has you climbing up from dealing 3 HP damage per hit, to slowly getting some simple special attacks to eventually unlocking impressive skills and magical attacks late I the game. While somewhat slow, it’s also nice because you will appreciate every new move and every step in your character growth more. \\nThe story is also slow, but I my opinion this is cute and endearing rather than annoying. There’s attention to detail and emotional fleshing out of the characters and the world. Sometimes it’s ludicrous elements can get a bit too much for me, like the son of the sand empire’s ruler being basically a complete faking useless douche, in general I do really like the pacing and the way in which the story unfold. And it does feel like you are really swept away on and adventure, sometimes choosing your own pace and sometimes being propelled forwards by events beyond your control. There’s side-quests and exploration is worthwhile as hidden items, crafting materials and chests can be anywhere."],
             ["You control a party of max 4 characters in battle, and in typical JRPG fashion the party members are unlocked In the game through story progression. The character design, in line with the graphical quality of the game is spot on. The main characters will grow on you and they’re all memorable. The ones that made the most lasting impression on me are for example  Jade who is basically a hot martial arts woman and Sylvando who has some traits of a flamboyant homosexual probably the most noteworthy ones. But they are all great, design and character wise. There’s alternative costumes which look cool as well so you can put your characters in your favorite style. And in it’s entirety my favorite part of playing this game was the feeling of really being in this magical, beautiful world. \\nBut it’s also really good gameplay wise. Dungeons are generally well-designed, barring a few annoying ones (which also belong in a RPG), usually long enough and with enough branches to be interesting but not big and complicated enough to feel like exploring is a chore. Every character has a style broadly fitting RPG archetypes (mage, healer, thief etc. ) but each character also has different kinds of weapons which can dramatically change their style. The thief Erik for example can handle sword or knives, but also boomerangs which always deal (usually less) damage to all enemies. There’s room for variation and different builds; different characters have healing skills and there’s a variety of buffs and debuffs as well to strategize with. You probably don’t need to many elaborate strategies for most of the game but you will at the end game. Besides the character’s unique skills, there an overdrive mechanic which allows for different kind of super attacks, which can combine with different characters for extra strong ones. They look cool and also adds another layer of team building. "], 
             ["My only issue with the game is that in a certain way it is so slow. I’m not talking about the story or the amount of gameplay as a typical JRPG pace is part of the genre but the game is also slow in introducing both difficulty and the more in-depth game mechanics. Most of all, some of the more interesting role-specific abilities get unlocked really late in the game (and it is a long game!), which is kind of good because it means you will still be unlocking worthwhile abilities end-game too but it is bad because it means you will be able to experiment the more interesting team builds quite late. Likewise the game is really slow to introduce new mechanics, almost to the point where the first whole third of the game is in some ways the tutorial (and we’re talking a 100+ hour game. There’s a genuinely good and fun crafting mechanism, but unfortunately you have to get pretty far into the game to really be able to make a nice variety of really useful items.\\nSome people hate the fact that the music plays non-stop: it goes from field tune to battle tune to town tune to field tune to dungeon tune to field tune, but a small variety of songs plays all the time. And it is typical Dragon Quest music which I guess can be it or miss, but I didn’t mind. Reminded me of the old days (which is probably exactly what it’s supposed to do). And anyway it is a solid qualitatively high JRPG soundtrack. What did annoy me however, was the fact that enemy battle cries are in these  8-bit sounds I remember straight from Dragon Warrior Game Boy games. It’s a cute thought but for me this does distract a bit and lessens the immersion.\\nThe overall quality, beauty and thorough polish and detail of the game does make up for it all and even when slow I regularly found myself just looking around at the world, the town and the characters. The main quest is long, even for a JRPG and will definitely surprise you. There’s good end game content as well, including some very difficult optional bosses and literally tons of collectable items, including alternatives costumes. "]]},

         "intro": "I came in completely fresh, having shamefully ignored the franchise before just because based on some images I dismissed it as some Japanese GTA imitation. I wasn’t just normal wrong, but it’s a completely different kind of game. A unique kind of game I dare say. Very strange, but awesome. And it turned out to be one of my favorite games I’ve played on the PS4. Unless you absolutely hate Japanese humor you should play this.",
         "score": "8",
         "conclusion": "This game is very strange, but in a good way: it had been a while since I played something that really felt lke a different genre. I gave it a try with some doubts but I came back a fan of the series and finished Yakuza Kiwami afterwards and I’ll soon start Kiwami 2 and the rest. I just love it’s typical Japanese mix of emotional storytelling with absurd and sometimes pervy humor. All in a really fun game with unique combat and solid action ROG mechanics.\\n The combat is simple yet interesting due to the different styles you can instantly switch too, and it gets challenging enough in the late game  & bosses. It gets better the more you choose to play in a way that you uses stylish moves for entertainment rather than just cheese battles. The RPG elements bring a solid feeling of progression and character growth, and the game has a LOT of optional content. I grinded to unlock all the special moves, hostesses, super rare weapons and just big money with pleasure. \\n But most of all, the style and general vibe of the game is why you should play it. The storytelling, setting and presentation is really good. The characters are awesome and you will feel heavily invested. Majima, Kuze & Kiryu are some of the most memorable characters of my PS4 time period. If you are able to look past the rough edges in the game world's details and the simple base of the combat you’re in for a gem of a game.  ",

         "text": [["As soon as the opening theme kicked in and the introductory cutscene ended I was hooked. The character design looks really good and the stage set by the music and art style is spot on.  But I still didn’t really know what exactly I’d be playing in a moment. Basically, what you can expect when you start playing yakuza 0 is an action RPG in a very engaging Japanese mafia (i.e. Yakuza) story. Set in the 80’s. The plot revolves around an organized crime war breaking out over the ownership an empty pace of ground that is the key to a huge government sponsored construction project. It’s well written and brought and you will be sucked in. The game is also very funny also full of typical absurd Japanese humor. For me the game’s strongest point is the weird mix of sometimes tear-jerking, merciless mafia story and the comical greatness where I actually laughed out loud  at times. The design and music are great and there’s definitely some memorable tunes on the OST like Kuze’s theme or Two Dragons. \\n The combat is all real-time but it’s RPG genre here shows in that the most important part of the combat is unlocking the moves and stat bonuses that fit your style, rather than mastering a fixed set of moves available from the beginning. Both playable characters have 3 different martial art styles which are unique with each it’s won strength and weaknesses. Enemies use different styles as well and it works; as your skills grow you will feel awesome switching around at the right time, using a defensive fast dodge style to evade some attacks early on, switch to the offensive Beast style to deal heavy damage to the nearest enemies and then back to dodge until you are at safe distance. The coolest thing about it are the so called “Heat” attacks, which require usage of a meter and allows for a very wide variety of special attacks which look awesome. The AI is rather dumb which shows especially when fighting groups of enemies as they’ll basically just do their own thing without coordination. While this could be better it’s not too bad for the kind of combat this game offers. "], ["The flow of the game has you roaming free in the game’s main hub, either the Kamurocho district of Tokyo (based on the real Kabuchiko going-out district), or Osaka based on your progress in the game. It is actually quite small, but to me it didn’t really feel like that until late in the game. Probably because you’ll steadily unlock new venues and scenes. You will be free to roam around, explore and find & do side-quests in between the story missions which are usually marked on the map. Aside from the side-quest there are phone cards to collect, random battles and Mr. Shakedown battles (a string buffed guy who will fight you to take your money if you run into him). The side-quest are not only funny, but they grant you worthwhile rewards as well like new hostesses for you club, weapons or upgrades. The story is well written and gets pretty deep with twists and emotional moments. The story advances in chapters and seeing your amount of cash grow, as well as expanding your move set and combat abilities does offer a nice feeling of progression.\\nThere’s tons of mini-games, including karaoke (Kiryu singing Baka Mitai will be in your head for life), arcade games, betting scantily clad women who are wrestling and especially two more important ones: managing a hostess club and managing a real estate firm. These are more fleshed out, offer more rewards and are integrated in the story. Especially the hostess club one can be strangely addictive. It’s really up to you whether you want to rush through the storyline, or whether you will indeed explore and take on the various challenges: there’s a fishing mini game, an arena, you get rewards for eating all the different foods and so on. While I did enjoy most of these things while playing this game, I honestly did enjoy most of these things slightly less in Yakuza Kiwami when I played it afterwards because they are very similar. So my guess is you will get to the bottom of it for sure in the first one you play, but you might leave some of it when you move to the next one. But the game is anyway great content-wise."],
          ["On a more critical note, the game can feel a bit messy sometimes as it is not always clear when a side-quest will be available somewhere or when doing a story mission will make a side-quest unavailable. Awesome and funny as most the side-quests are, sometimes it feels very out of place to be busy grabbing a kid an adult magazine from a vending machine in between the life-and-death drama of the main story. Most of them are funny and have some battles, but there’s also some uninteresting fetch quests among them. Besides, the character design is great but the world is sometimes a bit rough, especially the inside environments can look kinda bland and unpolished.\\nSome people complain about the combat being too simple and basically just charge up and spam your best special attack whenever you can, but I wouldn’t agree. I mean sure I’ve mindlessly Beast-styled my way though many a random street battle, but it’s a player’s choice to finish these battle’s in a stylish way if you’re curious to see all the special attacks. I went out of may way to do this, especially with the contextual ones which use objects (for example an electrical cooking plate) and it is rewarding to finish a battle with maybe some unnecessary effort, but a mad stylish finish. Besides, the boss battles require you to strategize and fight well by altering dodging styles, stun attacks and high damage styles to survive and chip away their health. And especially later in the game the story battles where you’re more outnumbered are also no cake-walk and I found myself being grateful using some of the rarer weapons I was grinding for. "]]
